                    <h3>MATERIAL STANDARDS</h3>
                    <p>Food ingredients have a long list of potential threats.
                        At Swanand, we provide safety for your ingredients and packaging before the next production stage.
                        We ensure careful segregation of ingredients. With distinctions such as allergens materials, we minimize any chance of cross-contamination.
                        The Food Safety Modernization Act became federal law in 2011.
                        This shifted the food safety focus from responding to contamination to attempting to prevent it.
                        Ingredient storage is a critical component of this change.
                        As a response to this new standard, Swanand works tirelessly to ensure our plants are always audit-ready, even for unannounced visits.</p>

                    <h3>STORAGE PROTECTION</h3>
                    <p>Our receiving personnel also know what to look for when the trucks arrive.
                        We use a rigorous check-in process for raw materials delivery to identify metal, glass, odors or other hazards that could jeopardize your ingredients.
                        Our workers are also careful to verify all materials and quantities to minimize errors and customer complaints.</p>

                    <h3>STORAGE CONVENIENCE</h3>

                        We also conduct a monthly physical inventory count to further audit our facilities, and all customers receive a monthly inventory report of their raw and finished materials</p>
